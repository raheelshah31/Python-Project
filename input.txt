to me, Shantanu, Mugdha 
Hi Raheel, 

Apologies in the delay in getting this to you. Forgot to hit send on the email on friday :(

As such I don't require the return of this until later in the week. Thurs / Fri would be acceptable. 

As I explained on Friday, I'd like you to complete the following small problems using Python (2.7) and post the completed solutions to your github user account. 
Please use a separate python file for each problem. 

Once this is done, simply send me a link to your github user page and I'll take a look. 

Do get in touch if you have any questions or issues. 

Thanks, 
Iain



Problem 1:

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage as above.


Problem 2:

Write a program that will take a text file as input and return a csv report listing alphabetically all the words in the file and the number of occurrences of each.
